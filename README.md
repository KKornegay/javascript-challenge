## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.


### Project

For this Project I was asked to:

* Create a basic HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appended a table to your web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure I had a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
